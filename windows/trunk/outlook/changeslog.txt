2010-11-04
  - toccy: reintegrated branch US6604: "1-way sync removal"

             * the default sync mode

           - SyncSettings UI changed: display the syncmode if it's a one-way
           - Source settings UI changed: dynamically use the editbox instead of the
             dropdown list if the available syncmode is only 1

2010-10-26
  - toccy: fixed bug 10260 - Yearly recurring events not added in Outlook 2003 and 2007 (Error inserting recurrence property 'Interval')
           On Outlook 2003 and 2007 the "interval" property is not set in yearly events,
           since it's not supported and may cause an error saving the recurrence pattern.

          Modified the dataTransformer for contact

2010-07-29
  - toccy: merged from branch v87:

           Now patternEndDate and Occurrences are both included in vCalendar, for compatibility.
           Some refactoring on the WinRecurrence::toString() method.

2010-07-13
  - maria: Release 8.7.1.

2010-07-28
  - toccy: created branch "files_sync".
           Added Files sync (like pictures sync, Server-to-Client only):
           - main screen: fixed UI pane, cannot be hidden
           - settings: source can be enabled/disabled, destination folder (default = user's documents dir), 
             remote URI (default = "file")
           - recover: only from server to client
           Notes:
           - Using VS2008 projects
           - Pictures source is fixed on UI too (no dynamically hidden)

2010-07-20
  - toccy: improved logging when error occurs saving a recurring event/task (print the list of all props)

2010-06-29
  - toccy: fixed bug #9556 - Some yearly events in VCAL format are not synced to the server
           Outlook APIs have a bug: yearly and yearNth recurrences (rec types 5 and 6) are returned
           with a wrong interval when read: interval 12,24,36... instead of 1,2,3.
           So an appropriate patch is applied to the interval value in ClientRecurrence.cpp.

2010-06-01
  - toccy: fixed bug #9324 -  Only the first exception in a recurring event is syncronized correctly from server to Outlook
           (APIs) The EXDATE and RDATE properties were not parsed correctly in WinEvent (only the first element was read)

2010-05-28
  - magi : fixed bug #9429 - Autoupdate pop-up remains in bg and client stops working. Modification into
           winmaincpp to put in foreground the client when an update popup comes up.  

  - toccy: fixed bug #8671  - Issue on recurring events on Outlook
           The 'change-day' flag is set to FALSE, so the events recurrence are always expected in local time.
           This is used ONLY when syncing against a Server that doesn't support events timezones (TZ).
           It's consistent, since the client always sends the events in local time + TZ, even if the
           Server doesn't support TZ.

2010-05-27
  - toccy: fixed appointments date filtering: it was disabled on a fresh install

                #9308 - The move of an item to a different folder on the Server, is not managed correctly
                #9306 - Cannot handle 2+ modified exceptions of a recurring event
                #6639 - Outlook inserts carriage return character in the contact's NOTE field

           New features (now disabled, can be enabled at build time):
                - Support for PIM shared folders
                - Added Send Log (via HTTP) from the Logging screen

                - Improved slow sync prompting policy (will not auto-continue if sync direction is set to one-way)
                - Added UI option: "Only sync when outlook is open" for scheduled sync
                - Warn user with a popup about switch from one-way to two-way syncs

                - send items as new instead of updated, if moved to another folder
                - don't send items out of the calendar filter as Deleted items
                - save the contact's "fileAs" field, otherwise it's auto generated by Outlook
                - avoid sync of calendar's attendees
                - hide the "include subfolders" UI checkbox, and force as it was enabled

                - Reverted usage of OEM devinfo param (it was used to store the Outlook version installed, but it's not correct)
                - Reverted USE_CHANGE_DAY = TRUE (btw it's not used since we use timezones for appointments)
                - Reverted default debug @ info, default target build @ release
                - Reverted some customization params, to keep current behavior:

                  * sourceDefaultEncoding = "bin" (was empty)
