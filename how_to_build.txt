How to build the Funambol Outlook Sync Client
*********************************************

1. Overview
   --------
    The Outlook Sync Client consists of 4 projects: 
    - OutlookPlugin: the GUI interface of the Plug-in, written in C++ with MFC support (Microsoft Foundation Classes) 
    - winmainclientdll: the Client DLL, used by OutlookPlugin, written in C++ with STL support (Standard Library) 
    - FunambolAddin: the COM Addin for Microsoft Outlook 
    - win32: the Funambol native API C++ for Windows32; winmainclientdll and FunambolAddin are based on this project 

    All projects are developed in C++. 


2. Requirements
   ------------
   To build Outlook Sync Client, make sure you have installed all the following into your Windows machine.
   Note: only Windows XP or later can be used.

    - Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. 
      The build process is automated using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 C++ compiler.
      Note: a different version of Visual Studio can be used as well, changing accordingly the build
            properties inside the install/build/funambol-outlook-client-forge.properties file.

    - Microsoft Outlook 2003 or later. 
      Outlook Sync Client uses some Microsoft Outlook libraries, so you need to install 
      Microsoft Outlook to register these libraries into the System. 

    - "Apache Ant" version 1.6.3 or higher (recommended v.1.7.1) 
      Downloadable from: http://ant.apache.org/
      Note: Apache Ant needs the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed in order to work 
            (see http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html#sysrequirements Note #2).

    - Ant contrib 0.6, required to run some ant tasks
      * Download "ant-contrib-0.6.jar" from 
        http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/cocoon-2.1.10/Downloadantcontrib06jar.htm
      * Copy the jar file under the folder "<ant-installation-dir>\lib" 

    - NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System), version 2.40 or higher
      Can be downloaded from: http://nsis.sourceforge.net
   
    - Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html) 
    
    - [optional] Graphviz (to generate graphs in doxygen doc, http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php)


3. Building the installer
   ----------------------
    The installer is a NSIS Windows installer, launched by the Apache 'ant' build tool.
    During the building process, all projects are compiled using the Visual Studio compiler.
    
    1) Checkout the Outlook Sync Client project from SVN.
       The project repository is: https://outlook-client.forge.funambol.org/svn/outlook-client/
       HEAD revision can be found under 'trunk/outlook' path, tags are located under 'tags' (use "guest" username with an empty password).
       Note: external projects (like Funambol C++ APIs) will be checkout automatically.
    2) Open file 'install\build\funambol-outlook-client-forge.properties'
       - redefine the path of Visual Studio 2005 (devenv.exe) (if different)
       - redefine the path of the directory 'redist\x86' of Visual Studio 2005 if necessary 
       - redefine the path of NSIS (makensis.exe) if necessary 
    3) Open file 'install\build\release.properties' and set the release version number desired.
    4) If you wish to build a "cared" version of Outlook Client, you need to create the folder 'install\installer\Redemption_Lib\enterprise' and
       copy there the distributable version of Redemption.dll (it's not free, can be purchsed from http://www.dimastr.com/redemption/download.htm).
    5) From directory 'install\build', type 'ant work-dev'. 
       This procedure will build the installer, doing the following: 
       - register Redemption library
       - create the doxygen documentation 
       - create a zip file containing the source files 
       - build the Outlook Sync Client installer
       
    Output files will be placed in 'install\output'.
    Doxygen documentation is generated in 'docs\html'; the start page is 'index.html'.
    
    Note: with "ant release" you can build the Outlook Sync Client installer as well, 
          but all source files will be downloaded from SVN by the script.
